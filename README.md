This plugin was coded by Markap for the StyleLabor server, but can be used freely by anyone. 

The plugin was coded because no plugin fulfilled what was needed. It will probably not have all the features of a long developed CookieClicker plugin. However, I am always trying to add new features!

## Important - Maybe broken features

- Having less than 7 upgrades was not tested! 
- When I test the plugin, I only use a MSQL (MariaDB) connection. I don't know if the plugin works with YML storage!
- I coded the plugin for the 1.20.4 version of Minecraft. I don't know if it works with the 1.21 because the java version is different there!
- When setting the storage to msql but the msql connection is not working, the plugin will not work and spam a lot of errors in the console.
- The code is very optimized, but I have not tested it with a lot of players.
